Developing Data Products Project

Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator:

the user must enter his/her weight and height in the fields designed to it (on the right, numeric values).

The app will calculate BMI (and recalculate it if new values of weight and height are entered) and, in the graph below, 
it will appear a cross symbol indicating the cualitative result as "underweight", "optimal weight" or "overweight" with 
reference to the classification for general adult population.
